The viaduct was designed to eliminate the railway grade crossing for major roads and a new Union Station for passenger traffic. The City, Toronto Harbour Commissioners, Grand Trunk Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway had their final design proposal approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners on July 1913. While the focus of the photographs is the road underpasses, they also document the extensive changes in railway infrastructure. Union Station, the architectural centrepiece for this engineering work, was also photographed extensively during construction. \nIn addition, these images capture the transformation of the waterfront that occurred at the same time. Many buildings, such as the old Toronto Electric Light Company steam powered generating station, were torn down to make way for the new elevated trackwork. Approximately 2.7 million cubic meters of earth was moved to increase the track's elevation, coming from borrow pits in Leaside and Scarborough. Also included in this project were underpasses on Eastern, Logan, Greenwood, Coxwell, and Woodbine to eliminate level crossings. Construction began June 1925 and was completed on January 1931."}

The viaduct was designed to eliminate the railway grade crossing for major roads and a new Union Station for passenger traffic. The City, Toronto Harbour Commissioners, Grand Trunk Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway had their final design proposal approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners on July 1913. While the focus of the photographs is the road underpasses, they also document the extensive changes in railway infrastructure. Union Station, the architectural centrepiece for this engineering work, was also photographed extensively during construction. \nIn addition, these images capture the transformation of the waterfront that occurred at the same time. Many buildings, such as the old Toronto Electric Light Company steam powered generating station, were torn down to make way for the new elevated trackwork. Approximately 2.7 million cubic meters of earth was moved to increase the track's elevation, coming from borrow pits in Leaside and Scarborough. Also included in this project were underpasses on Eastern, Logan, Greenwood, Coxwell, and Woodbine to eliminate level crossings. Construction began June 1925 and was completed on January 1931."}
