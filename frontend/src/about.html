    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to Back Lane Studios’ reboot of OldTO, an interactive map featuring a wealth of digitized historic photos from the City of Toronto Archives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to the work of Toronto software engineer Michael Lenaghan, we have been able to resurrect this mapping tool, originally built by Sidewalk Labs.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the company, now a Google subsidiary, abandoned its Quayside neighbourhood project on Toronto’s waterfront in 2020, it also discontinued its support of the OldTO site. Fortunately, the open-source software has remained available for public use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our city is changing more rapidly than ever. What was Toronto like in the past? How have neighbourhoods and our way of life evolved? We can learn much from the Archives’ rich photographic collections, which have come from individuals, companies, transit agencies, government departments, institutions and many other sources.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the Map</h2>

    <p>
      How does OldTO work? Click on a dot, and you’ll see photographs that have been “geocoded” – located on the map by longitude and latitude. The description attached to each image comes from the Toronto Archives.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are interested in a particular time period, you can adjust the date line on the left of your screen to designate years. You can also search by names of streets and neighbourhoods, but be aware, if you put in “Islington,” for example, you may end up looking at a map of London, England, unless you add “Toronto” to your search filter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aerial views of the city are also available by clicking on the “Aerial History” button on the bottom right of the screen. The slider bisecting the aerial view allows you to compare the past to the present day, which is on the right and in colour. These bird’s-eye views, taken over a period from 1947 to 1992, dramatically show Toronto’s rapid evolution. (If the aerial photos do not render properly on your computer, try another browser.)
    </p>

    <p>
      When OldTO ceased to exist, we at Back Lane Studios were deeply saddened. We loved being able to visit a neighbourhood and see what photos were available from the Archives. We are sure many others interested in the city’s history and their neighbourhoods were also disappointed. We hope this reboot will be welcomed.
    </p>

    <h2>Back Lane Studios</h2>

    <p>
      We are a neighbourhood not-for-profit in Toronto’s Roncesvalles neighbourhood. We offer a variety of programs, including photography for kids, writing and video workshops for adults, lectures and art exhibits. We have recently launched a project to map seniors’ recollections of their lives and neighbourhoods, capturing their stories in video, written form and photographs. Hence, our interest in mapping tools. We are calling our initiative Mapping our Memories.
    </p>

    <h2>OldTO’s History</h2>

    <p>
      Who built this site? Sidewalk Labs is an urban-planning company. Now part of Google, it was in Toronto to develop Quayside, a 12-acre site in Toronto’s Port Lands. The original OldTO website was built by a project team headed by senior software engineer Dan Vanderkam, who was also the creator of OldNYC and OldSF, both of which map images from city library archives. We are grateful to Sidewalk Labs for having made their mapping tool available as open-source software.
    </p>

    <p>
      The images: Our reboot of the OldTO site includes historic images from the City of Toronto Archives, which have been digitized and have a specific address or place mentioned in the photo description. This allows the image to be “geocoded” and mapped.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Archive’s on-line images are generally in the public domain and can be reused. You will find the description of each photo contains a title, usually a date, a description of the condition and any copyright restrictions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creators of OldTO did not collect or digitize any of these images. The Archives has taken on this huge job and is adding to its digitized library on a regular basis. The Archives has photos dating back to 1856.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Archives’ collection of aerial photos of Toronto, taken from 1947 to 1992, can also be viewed on our OldTO reboot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes photos may end up in the wrong place because of address errors and changes in street names and numbering. If you identify an error, please email us.
