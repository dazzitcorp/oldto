    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy"), together with the <a href="./terms.html">terms and conditions</a> (the "Terms and Conditions"), governs your use of <a href="/">www.oldto.org</a> (the "Site").</p>

    <p>By using the Site you indicate that you have read and understood the Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions, and that you agree to both.</p>

    <h2>Links</h2>

    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>

    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

    <h2>Collection</h2>

    <p>Like most websites, this Site collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>

    <p>This Site also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. This Site only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses other personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>User data will be stored until the purpose the data was collected for has been achieved.</p>

    <h2>Protection</h2>

    <p>While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure</h2>

    <p>The Site’s purpose in collecting user data is to better understand how the Site’s visitors use it.</p>

    <p>We may diclose aggregated user data, either privately or publicly.</p>

    <p>We may disclose unaggregated user data to any member of our organization who reasonably needs access to it, for the purposes set out in the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We will not sell or share unaggregated user data with any third parties, except in the following cases:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If the law requires it;</li>
      <li>If it is required for any legal proceeding; and</li>
      <li>To prove or protect our legal rights.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Requests</h2>

    <p>If you would like to know if we have collected your personal data, how we have used your personal data, if we have disclosed your personal data and to whom we disclosed your personal data, or if you would like your data to be deleted or modified in any way, you can contact us at: info@oldto.org</p>

    <h2>Third Parties</h2>

    <p>This Site uses Google Maps. The use of this Site is subject to the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <p>This site uses Plausible. Plausible provides privacy-aware website analytics. (Plausible does not use cookies, and does not track or collect any personal or personally identifiable information.)</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time in order to maintain compliance with the law and to reflect any changes to the way we operate the Site. We recommend that users periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure that they are aware of any changes.</p>
